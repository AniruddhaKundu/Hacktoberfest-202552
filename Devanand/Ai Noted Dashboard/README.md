# 🧠 AI Notes & To-Do Dashboard  
> A smart, voice-enabled personal productivity tool powered by browser AI features — for managing tasks, notes, and priorities effortlessly.

## 🚀 Overview  
The **AI Notes & To-Do Dashboard** is a lightweight, all-in-one productivity companion built using **pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — no frameworks required.  
It lets you quickly **add, organize, and track tasks** using **voice commands**, priority levels, due dates, and a built-in dark mode — all stored locally in your browser.  

This project is part of the **Devanand** collection of smart personal dashboards.

✅ **🧹 Clear Completed Tasks** — Keep your dashboard clean in one click.
