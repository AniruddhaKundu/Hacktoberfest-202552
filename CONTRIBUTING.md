## 🎯 How to Contribute

### 1. Find an Issue

Look for issues labeled with:
- `good first issue` - Perfect for newcomers
- `hacktoberfest` - Specifically for Hacktoberfest
- `help wanted` - We need your expertise
- `bug` - Something needs fixing
- `enhancement` - New features or improvements

### 2. Create a Branch

```bash
# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# or for bug fixes
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
```

### 3. Make Your Changes

- Write clean, readable code
- Follow our coding standards (see below)
- Add tests for new features
- Update documentation if needed
- Ensure all tests pass

### 4. Commit Your Changes

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for our commit messages:

```bash
# Examples of good commit messages
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication system"
git commit -m "fix: resolve login button styling issue"
git commit -m "docs: update API documentation"
git commit -m "test: add unit tests for user service"
```

### 5. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
# Push to your fork
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then create a Pull Request on GitHub with:
- A clear title describing what you've done
- A detailed description of your changes
- Screenshots (if applicable)
- References to related issues

## 🎨 Coding Standards

### JavaScript/TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Write JSDoc comments for functions
- Prefer const over let, avoid var

```typescript
// ✅ Good
const calculateTotalPrice = (items: Item[]): number => {
  return items.reduce((total, item) => total + item.price, 0);
};

// ❌ Bad
var calc = (arr) => {
  let tot = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    tot += arr[i].price;
  }
  return tot;
};
```

### React Components

- Use functional components with hooks
- Use TypeScript interfaces for props
- Keep components small and focused
- Use proper error boundaries

```tsx
// ✅ Good
interface ButtonProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  onClick: () => void;
  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary';
}

const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({ 
  children, 
  onClick, 
  variant = 'primary' 
}) => {
  return (
    <button 
      className={`btn btn-${variant}`} 
      onClick={onClick}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  );
};
```

### CSS/Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Avoid custom CSS when possible
- Use semantic class names for custom styles
- Ensure responsive design

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for new features
- Aim for at least 80% code coverage
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

```typescript
// ✅ Good test
describe('calculateTotalPrice', () => {
  it('should return 0 for empty items array', () => {
    // Arrange
    const items: Item[] = [];
    
    // Act
    const result = calculateTotalPrice(items);
    
    // Assert
    expect(result).toBe(0);
  });
});
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

## 📝 Documentation Guidelines

- Update README.md if you add new features
- Add JSDoc comments to functions
- Update API documentation for backend changes
- Include code examples in documentation
