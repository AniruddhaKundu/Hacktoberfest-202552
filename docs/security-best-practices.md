# 🔐 Security Best Practices Guide

This document outlines essential security best practices for developing, deploying, and maintaining this application securely.

---

## 1. 🔑 Authentication

- Use **strong password policies** (min 8 chars, mix of symbols, numbers, letters).
- Store passwords using **bcrypt** or **Argon2** hashing algorithms.
- Implement **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** where possible.
- Use **OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect** for third-party authentication.
- Invalidate sessions and tokens on logout or password change.

---

## 2. 🛡️ Data Protection

- Use **HTTPS (TLS 1.2 or above)** for all API and web traffic.
- Sanitize all input to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL, XSS).
- Use **environment variables** to store secrets, not in code.
- Encrypt sensitive data at **rest** (e.g., AES-256) and in **transit**.
- Avoid logging sensitive data (e.g., passwords, tokens, PII).

## 3. 🐛 Common Vulnerabilities to Watch

- **SQL Injection**  
  Use parameterized queries or ORM like Prisma/Sequelize/Mongoose.

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**  
  Escape user input and use a secure templating engine.

- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**  
  Use CSRF tokens and `SameSite` cookies.

- **Insecure Deserialization**  
  Never trust serialized data from clients.

- **Security Misconfigurations**  
  - Use security headers (`helmet` in Express)
  - Disable directory listing
  - Remove unused routes/services

---

## 4. 🧪 Testing & Monitoring

- Use tools like **OWASP ZAP**, **Snyk**, or **npm audit** to find vulnerabilities.
- Add **unit and integration tests** for auth flows and permissions.
- Monitor logs for suspicious activity.
