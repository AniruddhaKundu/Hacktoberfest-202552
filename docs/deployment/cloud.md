# Cloud Deployment (Guidance)

This guide gives general recommendations and concrete examples for deploying the repository to cloud providers. Because the repo contains multiple small projects and services, the guide focuses on container-first approaches (recommended) and serverless options when applicable.

## Strategy (recommended)
1. Package each runnable service as a container image.
2. Push images to a registry (Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry, Amazon ECR, Azure Container Registry, Google Container Registry).
3. Deploy containers to a managed service: Cloud Run (GCP), App Service / Container Apps (Azure), ECS/Fargate or EKS (AWS), or Kubernetes.

## Prepare images
- Build images as shown in `docs/deployment/containerized.md` and tag them with the registry path.

Example tagging and pushing to Docker Hub:

```powershell
docker tag hacktober-backend:latest yourdockerhubuser/hacktober-backend:latest ;
docker push yourdockerhubuser/hacktober-backend:latest
```

## Example: Deploy to Google Cloud Run (Containerized)
1. Install `gcloud` and authenticate.
2. Build and push image to Artifact Registry / Container Registry or use `gcloud builds submit`.
3. Deploy:

```powershell
gcloud run deploy hacktober-backend \
  --image=REGION-docker.pkg.dev/PROJECT/REPO/hacktober-backend:latest \
  --platform=managed \
  --region=us-central1 \
  --allow-unauthenticated \
  --set-env-vars=DATABASE_URL=postgres://...
```

## Example: Deploy to Azure Container Apps
1. Use Azure CLI to create a resource group, container registry, and container app environment.
2. Push the image to ACR and deploy using `az containerapp create`.

## Example: Deploy to AWS Fargate (ECS)
1. Push image to ECR.
2. Create a task definition referencing the image.
3. Create an ECS service on Fargate using the task definition.

## Database & Secrets
- Use managed DB services: Cloud SQL (GCP), Azure Database for PostgreSQL, Amazon RDS. Configure network access and credentials using secrets or provider-managed secrets.
- Avoid committing secrets into the repo: use cloud secret stores or environment variables in the provider's UI/infra.

## Observability
- Configure provider logging/monitoring (Cloud Logging, Azure Monitor, CloudWatch).
- Add health endpoints to services (`/health`, `/ready`) for the platform to perform readiness/liveness checks.

## Kubernetes (if you intend to manage infra)
- Provide sample k8s manifests (Deployment, Service, ConfigMap, Secret) and Helm chart if needed.
- Use HorizontalPodAutoscaler for scaling.

## Troubleshooting common cloud issues
- Image not starting: check container logs from provider UI or use `gcloud` / `az` / `aws` to fetch logs.
- DB connection: confirm VPC/network, firewall rules, and correct connection string.
- Environment variables not applied: verify the provider's config and restart the service.

If you want, I can add provider-specific one-click templates:
- `cloud/aws/` with Terraform + ECR/ECS examples
- `cloud/gcp/` with Cloud Run and Cloud SQL example
- `cloud/azure/` with Container Apps and Azure Database example

Tell me which provider(s) you'd like next and I will scaffold templates and commands.
