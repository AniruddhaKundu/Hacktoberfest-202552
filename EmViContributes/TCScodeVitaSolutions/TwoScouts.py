# another graph represnetaion problem
# i need to find the minimum number of the two scouts path
# two conditions. 1. a town should not be visited twice. 2. no town should be shared along the path except source and destination
# tricky part is to find total number of towns visited. since both scouts are not simple union of nodes
# the best solution would be to use DFS for 1st scout and BFS for second while restricting access to already travelled nodes
