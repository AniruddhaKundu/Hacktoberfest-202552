# Security Policy

## üîí Security

We take the security of our Hacktoberfest 2025 project seriously. This document outlines security procedures and general policies for the project.

## üö® Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in our project, we encourage you to let us know right away. We will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to quickly fix the problem.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

Please email security reports to: **[hariompandit5556@gmail.com](mailto:hariompandit5556@gmail.com)**

To help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue, please include as much of the following information as possible:

- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices for Contributors

When contributing to this project, please follow these security best practices:

### Code Security

- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: Never commit API keys, passwords, or other sensitive information
- **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
- **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies up to date and avoid packages with known vulnerabilities
- **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in error messages

### Environment Variables

Use environment variables for sensitive configuration:

```bash
# Good ‚úÖ
const apiKey = process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN;

# Bad ‚ùå
const apiKey = "ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx";
```

### Dependencies

- Regularly update dependencies: `npm audit fix`
- Use `package-lock.json` to ensure consistent installations
- Avoid dependencies with known security vulnerabilities

### Frontend Security

- Sanitize user-generated content to prevent XSS attacks
- Use HTTPS for all external API calls
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Validate data on both client and server side

### Backend Security

- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Use proper authentication and authorization
- Validate and sanitize all inputs
- Use security headers (helmet.js for Express)

## üîç Security Measures in This Project

This project implements several security measures:

### Automated Security Scanning

- **GitHub Security Advisories**: Automatically scan for vulnerabilities in dependencies
- **CodeQL Analysis**: Static code analysis for security issues
- **Dependabot**: Automatic security updates for dependencies

### CI/CD Security

- Security linting in GitHub Actions
- Automated dependency vulnerability scanning
- Secret scanning to prevent accidental commits of sensitive data

### Code Review Process

- All pull requests require review before merging
- Security-focused code review guidelines
- Automated security checks in PR workflow

## üìã Security Checklist for Pull Requests

Before submitting a PR, ensure:

- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- [ ] All user inputs are properly validated
- [ ] Dependencies are up to date and secure
- [ ] Error messages don't expose sensitive information
- [ ] HTTPS is used for all external requests
- [ ] Proper authentication/authorization is implemented
- [ ] Security headers are configured
- [ ] Input sanitization is in place

## üö´ Security Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Don't Do This ‚ùå

```javascript
// Hardcoded credentials
const password = "admin123";

// SQL injection vulnerability
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId}`;

// XSS vulnerability
document.innerHTML = userInput;

// Exposing sensitive data in errors
catch (error) {
  res.status(500).json({ error: error.message, stack: error.stack });
}
```

### Do This Instead ‚úÖ

```javascript
// Environment variables
const password = process.env.ADMIN_PASSWORD;

// Parameterized queries
const query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?";
db.query(query, [userId]);

// Proper escaping
document.textContent = userInput;

// Safe error handling
catch (error) {
  console.error(error); // Log for developers
  res.status(500).json({ error: "Internal server error" }); // Generic message for users
}
```

## üîÑ Security Updates

This security policy is regularly reviewed and updated. Security updates and patches are released as needed.

### Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | ‚úÖ Fully supported |
| 0.x.x   | ‚ùå Not supported   |

## üèÜ Recognition

We appreciate responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. Contributors who report valid security issues will be:

- Acknowledged in our security advisory (if desired)
- Listed in our contributors section
- Eligible for special recognition badges
